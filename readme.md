#Babel & Foundation 6 Build System (Using Browserify)

More toying around with Gulp.  This time with Babel and Foundation 6

To get started run

`npm install`

`bower install`

Also keep in mind that I'm using Gulp 4 in its "pre-released" version so I had to install the gulp 4 CLI globally using

`npm install -g "gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0"`
